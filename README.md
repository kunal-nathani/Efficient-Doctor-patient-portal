# Efficient-Doctor-patient-portal

Today in spite of major advancement in the medical science, still the people are
suffering because of many reasons .These reasons can be classified on the basis
of:-
A) Patient
One of the Major problem faced on the Doctor side is discussed below:
1) Not consuming Medicines at proper time:-
 The medicines are manufactured considering the timing of the
medicine consumption, so that the medicine is most effective for
the patient to recover at a better rate. This is why the doctors
recommend the perfect timing for the medicine consumption while
prescribing the medicine.
 But most of the patients forget to consume the medicine at timing
provided by the doctor, because of their busy schedule, hence the
medicine will not be effective as it should be. This becomes a habit
and increases the time period required to cure the disease and give
birth to new diseases

This chapter will describe the concept of project both on Doctor and
patient side. This chapter will give the project idea and Features related to
this webpage.


2) Handling of Reports:-
 Once a patient is cured from a disease, he or she often forgets to
store the reports related to that disease, which may cause a
problematic scenario in the treatment of the diseases encountered in
future.
 During each visit the reports play an import role for helping the
doctor to know the medical history of the patient. The medical
history also effects the current treatment procedure. Generally
keeping the reports available anytime and storing them properly is a
major responsibility of the patient. But since the user is not handle
this responsibility properly, he faces the above stated problems.

3) Health Guidelines:-
Mostly all the patients lack a proper diet, due to this there are major
factors like causing of less immunity to the patients which leads the
patient prone to diseases. A proper health guidelines can resolve this
problem.

B) Doctor
One of the Major problems faced on the Doctor side is discussed below:
1) Lack of Skills:-
Becoming a doctor by profession is a risk because it is related to
health of a person. Any mistake from the doctor side can cost
him the life of the patient.

 There are many graduates in medical science and the lack in
experience, so if the encounter an unexpected condition there
must be a way from where they can communicate with experts
and gain the proficiency.

2) Storing patients history using file:-
 The reports of patient are stored in files in many of the
hospitals. Which can be damaged by person or by nature that
is rainy weather and no space for storing file can affect file
and damage it.
 When the information is stored in files they can be stolen by
any of the person and he/she can easily know about medical
condition of patient there is not much security when they
store medical history in files
 It also consume more space the doctor have to buy some
accessories to store patient information.

3) Old Organ Donation System:-
 The old organ donation system consist of the form which
was to be filled by Donor and same was with patient who
needed organ.
 They had to see that the blood group also matches.
It is difficult to find organs offline.


Idea behind project:
The main idea behind the development of the project is to reduce the
overheads and the problems faced by the patients and the respected
Doctors.

We have Developed a Web-Based Application. Which focuses on the
overall development of the bits of medical care which should be
taken. As the small precautions can prevent big disorders. The
application stores the schedule of the Appointments for the patient &amp;
It also has an Organ Donation system which helps doctor as well as an
patient.
As there is a lot of medical tests a person undergoes and keeping the
complete record of this in hardcopy is an difficult task, to cope over
this scenario the Web-Application stores the records in Cloud Storage.
This enables the patient to retrieve the complete medical history
dynamically from anywhere just by logging into the application. This
means that if the user loses his device, he/she can still retrieve the data
by logging in with the email from any device. Thus the idea behind
this application is to solve the above stated problems.

Features of application:-
I. It offers a lot of flexibility to customize the schedule of Appointment
as per your need for each medication.
II. These Web Applications can be used pretty easily as they are
designed with ease of use in mind. The functionality is always kept
very simple so users donâ€™t come across any difficulty in using them.
III. The Organ donation system has a Dropdown list of organs which is
easy to use just click whichever organ you want and you will get
information about the organ if it is available.
IV. The patient has a form which helps doctor to find medical history
of the patient and to store it online on website. The data which is
uploaded is more secure as there is username and password for both
patient and doctor
V. It allows the patients to retrieve their reports from any place any time.
